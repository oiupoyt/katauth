# 🛡️ KatIPAuth (KIA)

> cracked server problems require cracked server solutions

**KatIPAuth** is a Paper plugin for **Minecraft 1.21.x** that locks accounts to IPs so little gremlins can’t just change usernames and steal accounts.  
No passwords. No auth plugins. Just **IP says yes or go home**.

Built for cracked servers. Optimized. Async. Doesn’t freeze your server like half the plugins on Spigot.

## 🚀 What This Plugin Does (aka why this exists)

Cracked servers have one big issue:

> usernames are free real estate

KatIPAuth fixes that by **binding each username to an IP address**.

### Core behavior
- First join → IP gets saved
- Next joins → must be same IP
- Different IP?
  - ❌ Login blocked **before they enter**
  - 📢 Discord webhook alert gets fired
  - 🧍 Player stays OUT. No spawn, no chunks, no funny business

---

## 🔐 Features

### 👤 Player Protection
- Automatic IP binding on first join
- Zero setup for players
- Login blocked instantly on mismatch

### 📡 Discord Alerts (cool embeds, not ugly spam)
Sends a clean embed with:
- Player username
- Stored IP
- Attempted IP
- Timestamp
- Server name  

So you can watch account theft attempts like a Netflix series.

### ⚡ Performance
- **Async disk I/O**
- **Async webhook requests**
- Never blocks the main thread
- Safe on restarts and reloads

---

## 🧾 Commands

### Player Commands

- Resets your IP binding
- Instantly kicks you
- Next login = new IP bound
#### /ipstatus

### Admin Commands (OP only, no funny business)
